# A Journey in Python, AI, and Beyond

## Introduction

Welcome! I'm M. A., an aspiring developer with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence, General AI, Generative AI, and web development. This GitHub repository is a chronicle of my journey to become a well-rounded developer, documenting my daily progress, learnings, and projects across various domains of technology.

## My Learning Path

- **Broadening Horizons**: While I initially focused on Python programming for computer vision applications, my long-term goal is to excel in various AI fields. This includes exploring areas like AGI, Generative AI, and expanding into web development.
- **Structured Learning via MOOC**: Currently, I am enhancing my skills through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). This course, although not specifically tailored for computer vision or AI, is providing me with a robust foundation in Python, essential for my diverse interests in technology.

## Projects and Progress

In this repository, you'll find an array of projects showcasing my skills in Python, AI, and more. Each project is a step towards my goal of mastering different aspects of technology.

### Featured Projects

- [**Day #001** :](Projects/Day_001/) On the very first day of my Python journey, I embarked on creating practical applications to solidify my understanding of the basics. The highlight of this day was the **Band Name Generator**. **Band Name Generator** is simple Python application that creatively combines user input to generate unique band names. This project served as an excellent introduction to handling strings and user input in Python, marking the start of my journey in programming and problem-solving.
- [**Day #002** :](Projects/Day_002/) The second day of my Python journey saw me diving into four engaging beginner-level projects. I started with a program that adds the digits of a two-digit number, honing my basic arithmetic skills. Following this, I created a BMI Calculator that uses height and weight to compute body mass index, offering practical experience with numerical inputs. Next was the Life in Weeks Calculator, a unique application that calculates the remaining weeks of life based on current age, furthering my data manipulation abilities. Lastly, I developed a Tip Calculator that evenly splits a bill, including tips, among diners, showcasing more advanced arithmetic operations and user input handling in Python.
- [**Day #003** :](Projects/Day_003/) On the third day of my Python journey, I dove into the world of conditionals and logical operators. The day was packed with five distinct projects, each enhancing my understanding of these crucial programming concepts. I started with an  **Odd and Even Number Classifier** , a program that helped me grasp basic conditional statements. Next, I created an **Obesity Calculator** based on BMI, which was an interesting way to apply conditionals in a practical context. The third project was a  **Leap Year Classifier** , challenging me to use more complex conditions. Then, I experimented with a playful **Love Calculator** based on names, adding a creative twist to string manipulation and logical operators. The day's crowning achievement was the  **Treasure Island Game** , an engaging and fun project that combined all the learned concepts into an interactive game. This day was not just about coding but also about enjoying the process and seeing the real-world application of Python in problem-solving and game development.
- [**Day #004** :](Projects/Day_004/) On the fourth day of my journey, I explored the concepts of randomization and lists in Python. The day was filled with engaging projects that ranged from simple to challenging. I began with a  **Random Head and Tail Selector** , a project that introduced me to the basics of randomization. Following this, I tackled the **Treasure Map** project, which was more complex and tested my skills in list manipulation. The day's final project was the  **Rock Paper Scissors Game** , a classic application of randomization and conditional logic, providing a fun and comprehensive review of the day's learnings.

## Daily Learning Updates

I am a firm believer in the power of daily learning and consistent growth. Here, I share my daily updates â€” be it a new concept, a project milestone, or an interesting challenge. It's a transparent view into my learning process.

## Future Goals

- **Diverse AI Expertise**: Aspire to gain expertise not only in computer vision but also in broader AI fields.
- **Web Development**: Plan to expand my skill set to include web development, recognizing its significance in the AI and tech landscape.
- **AGI and Generative AI**: Keen interest in exploring the cutting-edge realms of AGI and Generative AI.
