# A Journey in Python, AI, and Beyond

## Introduction

Welcome! I'm M. A., an aspiring developer with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence, General AI, Generative AI, and web development. This GitHub repository is a chronicle of my journey to become a well-rounded developer, documenting my daily progress, learnings, and projects across various domains of technology.

## My Learning Path

- **Broadening Horizons**: While I initially focused on Python programming for computer vision applications, my long-term goal is to excel in various AI fields. This includes exploring areas like AGI, Generative AI, and expanding into web development.
- **Structured Learning via MOOC**: Currently, I am enhancing my skills through the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). This course, although not specifically tailored for computer vision or AI, is providing me with a robust foundation in Python, essential for my diverse interests in technology.

## Projects and Progress

In this repository, you'll find an array of projects showcasing my skills in Python, AI, and more. Each project is a step towards my goal of mastering different aspects of technology.

### Featured Projects

- **Band Name Generator** (`projects/Day#001/1_band_name_generator.py`): [Band Name Generator]([100DaysOfPythonCoding/Projects/Day#001/1_brand_name_generator.py](https://github.com/mohliyet/100DaysOfPythonCoding/blProjects/Day#001/1_brand_name_generator.py)) This was my first Python project. It's a simple yet fun application that combines user input to generate unique band names. This project was a great introduction to Python basics, like handling strings and user input.

## Daily Learning Updates

I am a firm believer in the power of daily learning and consistent growth. Here, I share my daily updates — be it a new concept, a project milestone, or an interesting challenge. It's a transparent view into my learning process.

## Future Goals

- **Diverse AI Expertise**: Aspire to gain expertise not only in computer vision but also in broader AI fields.
- **Web Development**: Plan to expand my skill set to include web development, recognizing its significance in the AI and tech landscape.
- **AGI and Generative AI**: Keen interest in exploring the cutting-edge realms of AGI and Generative AI.
